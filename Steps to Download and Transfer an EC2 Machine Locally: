- Provide an **Image name** and **Description**.
- Choose whether to include additional EBS volumes if any.
- Click **Create Image**.

**CLI Command:**
You can also create an AMI using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ec2 create-image --instance-id <INSTANCE_ID> --name "<IMAGE_NAME>" --no-reboot
```

- Replace `<INSTANCE_ID>` with your EC2 instance ID.
- Replace `<IMAGE_NAME>` with your desired AMI name.

#### **2. Share the AMI with Another AWS Account**

**a.** Go to the AMI Section:
- In the EC2 dashboard, click **AMIs** under the **Images** section.

**b.** Select the AMI to Share:
- Find the AMI you created, right-click, and select **Modify Image Permissions**.

**c.** Add the Target AWS Account ID:
- Choose **Private**.
- Enter the **AWS Account ID** of the account you want to share the AMI with.
- Click **Save**.

**CLI Command:**
You can also share the AMI using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --image-id <AMI_ID> --launch-permission "Add=[{UserId=<TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>}]"
```

- Replace `<AMI_ID>` with your AMI ID.
- Replace `<TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` with the AWS Account ID of the target account.

#### **3. Accept the Shared AMI in the Target Account**

**a.** Log in to the Target AWS Account:
- Switch to the target AWS account or ask the recipient to log in.

**b.** Find the Shared AMI:
- Go to the EC2 dashboard, click **AMIs** under **Images**.
- Select **Private images** under the **Owned by me** dropdown.
- You should see the shared AMI.

**c.** Copy the Shared AMI to Your Region (if needed):
- If the AMI is in a different region, you may want to copy it to your preferred region.

**CLI Command:**
You can copy the AMI using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id <AMI_ID> --source-region <SOURCE_REGION> --region <TARGET_REGION> --name "<NEW_AMI_NAME>"
```

- Replace `<AMI_ID>`, `<SOURCE_REGION>`, and `<TARGET_REGION>` with your specific values.

---

#### **4. Launch a New EC2 Instance from the AMI**

**a.** Go to the AMI Section in the Target Account:
- In the EC2 dashboard, click **AMIs** and select the shared AMI.

**b.** Launch the Instance:
- Select the AMI and click **Launch**.
- Choose an instance type and configure the instance settings (e.g., network, security groups).
- Click **Review and Launch** and then **Launch**.

**c.** Assign or Create a Key Pair:
- If you need SSH access, make sure to create or select an existing key pair.

**CLI Command:**
You can also launch an EC2 instance from an AMI using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI_ID> --count 1 --instance-type <INSTANCE_TYPE> --key-name <KEY_PAIR_NAME> --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID> --security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID>
```

- Replace `<AMI_ID>`, `<INSTANCE_TYPE>`, `<KEY_PAIR_NAME>`, `<SUBNET_ID>`, and `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with your specific values.

### **Manual and Additional Considerations**

1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Make sure that the VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and other networking settings are configured similarly in the new account.

2. **EBS Volumes:**
   - If you have additional data in EBS volumes that are not part of the root volume, you need to create snapshots of those volumes and share them with the new account. Attach them to the new instance after launch.

3. **IAM Roles and Policies:**
   - Ensure that any IAM roles and policies required by the instance are correctly set up in the new account.

4. **Elastic IPs:**
   - If the original instance used an Elastic IP, youâ€™ll need to allocate a new one in the target account.

5. **Security:**
   - Review and update security group rules, key pairs, and other security settings as needed.
